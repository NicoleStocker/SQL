I used SQLite Studio to query the Chinook database that had 11 tables in it.

#1 Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Customerid, Country
FROM customers
WHERE country != "USA";

#2 Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Customerid, Country
FROM customers
WHERE country = "Brazil";

#3 Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices as inv 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust 
ON inv.customerid = cust.customerid
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil";

#4 Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title = "Sales Support Agent";

#5 Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6 Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. 
SELECT emp.lastname, emp.firstname, cust.supportrepid, inv.invoiceid
FROM chinook.invoices as inv
JOIN chinook.customers as cust 
ON inv.customerid = cust.customerid
JOIN chinook.employees as emp
ON cust.SupportRepID = emp.EmployeeId;

#7 Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT emp.lastname, emp.firstname, cust.firstname, cust.lastname, cust.country, inv.total
FROM chinook.invoices as inv
JOIN chinook.customers as cust 
ON inv.customerid = cust.customerid
JOIN chinook.employees as emp
ON cust.SupportRepID = emp.EmployeeId;

#8 How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#9 What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';


#10 Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.Tracks t
ON t.trackid = i.trackid;


#11 Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT a.Name as Artist, t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.Tracks t
ON t.trackid = i.trackid
JOIN albums al
ON al.Albumid = t.Albumid
JOIN artists a
ON a.Artistid = al.Artistid
ORDER BY Artist;

#12 Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.Name, al.title as Album, g.name as Genre, m.name as Media
FROM chinook.tracks t
INNER JOIN chinook.albums al
ON al.albumid = t.albumid
INNER JOIN chinook.genres g
ON t.genreid = g.genreid
INNER JOIN chinook.media_types m
ON m.mediatypeid = t.mediatypeid;

#13 Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, ROUND(SUM(i.total), 2) AS Total_Sales
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON e.employeeid = c.supportrepid
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.customerid = i.customerid
WHERE e.title = "Sales Support Agent"
GROUP BY e.FirstName;

#14 Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, ROUND(SUM(i.total), 2) AS Total_Sales
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON e.employeeid = c.supportrepid
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.customerid = i.customerid
WHERE e.title = "Sales Support Agent"
AND i.invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'
GROUP BY e.FirstName
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC LIMIT 1;
